# Kidney_Disease_Analysis_With_MachineLearning_And_Automation

Kidney disease can affect your body’s ability to clean our blood, filter extra water out of our blood, and help control your blood pressure. It can also affect red blood cell production and vitamin D metabolism needed for bone health.

When your kidneys are damaged, waste products and fluid can build up in your body. That can cause swelling in your ankles, nausea, weakness, poor sleep, and shortness of breath. Without treatment, the damage can get worse and your kidneys may eventually stop working. That’s serious, and it can be life-threatening.

Dataset concentrates on chronic kidney disease. Both numerical data and categorical data are given in the dataset. Id, age, bp, sg, al, su, rbc, pc, pcc, ba, bgr, bu, sc, sod, pot, hemo, pcv ,wc, rc, htn ,dm, cad, appet, pe, ane and classification. Firstly, cleaned the missing values using mode imputation, mean imputation, then  did exploratory data analysis to analyze the data in better way. Then drawn distplots, statsmodels to choose the feature which is affecting target more. Then applied many algorithms on the given dataset and concluded that is LR better model by considering many evaluation metrics.

Finally Used UiPath For Automating The process of Training the Model.UiPath is a Robotic Process Automation tool which is used for Windows desktop automation. It is used to automate repetitive and redundant tasks and eliminates the human intervention.
